# Comixplain test index

Comixplain is proposed to promote student-centred teaching and learning. As students vary in their previous knowledge and preferences, we propose alternative didactic materials to cater to individual learning processes. We propose a novel storytelling-based strategy to engage students in learning complex scientific subjects through comics.
